## Welcome to the "Game On 2022" EDA Project!

In this project, we will be conducting an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the video games that have been or will be released in the year 2022. The dataset used in this project is sourced from a variety of sources such as game development studios and gaming news outlets and comprises of various features such as game title, release date, genre, platform, and more.

The goal of this project is to gain insights into the trends and patterns in the video game industry in 2022. This includes identifying the most popular genres, platforms, and development studios, as well as analyzing the distribution of release dates throughout the year. Additionally, we will also be building visualizations to better understand the data and uncover any interesting findings.

We will be using the Python programming language and its various data analysis and visualization libraries such as Pandas, NumPy and Matplotlib, for this project. Therefore, a basic understanding of Python and these libraries will be helpful, but not necessary to understand the project.

We have provided a Jupyter notebook, that includes all the code, analysis and visualizations, in this repository for your reference. Additionally, we also have a detailed documentation that explains the entire project in a more comprehensive way.

This project is not only helpful for game enthusiasts but also for anyone interested in analyzing data, learning about data visualization and trends in the gaming industry.

We hope you find this project informative and interesting. Happy exploring!
